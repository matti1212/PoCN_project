This folder contains all the dataframes with bond percolation results, as retrieving these data is significantly faster than recomputing them from scratch using the bond percolation process. These dataframes should be viewed as intermediate results rather than final outputs, as they are intended for further analysis. The analysis has been conducted using the following files:
